# Hello, World!

I'm Ramiro from Berlin. I like solving problems with code. I created [my first web page](http://web.archive.org/web/19990429221519/http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/students/Ramiro/Ramiro.html) in 1997 and released [my first open source](https://github.com/yaph/berlinifyer) project in 2002. These days I mainly work on creating graphics and automating things.
