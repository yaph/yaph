# Hello, World!

## Open Source

I have published a lot of the code I've written for my personal projects since I released my [first open source project](https://github.com/yaph/berlinifyer) in 2002. I mainly program in Python and JavaScript and maintain several packages on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~rg) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/ramiro/).

## Websites

I've created a number of websites since I published my [my first web page](http://web.archive.org/web/19990429221519/http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/students/Ramiro/Ramiro.html) in 1997. I currently focus on the following ones:

* [geeksta.net](https://geeksta.net/) - Articles, tools and merchandise for IT geeks.
* [programminglanguages.info](https://programminglanguages.info/) - An informational website dedicated to computer programming languages.
* [ukealong.com](https://ukealong.com/) - A website for ukulele players featuring videos to play along.
